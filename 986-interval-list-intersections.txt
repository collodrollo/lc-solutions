-initialize intersection array
-it's important that intervals are sorted and disconnected
-first solve how to determine intersection from two intervals
-now problem is similar to merging two sorted lists
-issue is how to decide when to advance each pointer
-solution is to keep the pointer with the interval that
 still has more to offer
-in this case that would be the interval that ends the latest
-advance the pointer that ends earliest
-work finished when loop terminates, return intersection array
-O(N)
