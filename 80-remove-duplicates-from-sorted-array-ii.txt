-obvious approach is to pop off every item whose count exceeds 2, but popping in the middle 
 of array is O(N), making the algo O(N^2)
-rotating each excessive element to the end of the array yields similar results
-when faced with a situation like this, place a left pointer just after the final allowable
 element and advance the right pointer until a new element is reached
-replace element at left pointer with element from right pointer and advance both
 until right pointer reaches end of the array
-pop off all garbage elements at end of array
-O(N)
