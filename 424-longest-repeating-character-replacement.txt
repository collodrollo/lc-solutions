-note that the question boils down to "what is the longest string you can have such that
 the number of characters other than the single most frequent is <= k"
-sliding window
-keep a dictionary count of all characters -- O(1) since only 26 characters
-if all non most-frequent characters are <= k, update max length (r - l + 1 - max(counts.values()) <= k)
-otherwise, advance the window (do not shrink)
-O(N)
