naive:
-while loop through, insert an additional zero every time a zero is encountered
-don't forget to increment twice when a zero is inserted to avoid infinite loop
-pop off end of arr until length equals original arr
-O(N^2)

best:
-count zeros, stop when there wouldn't be room for another insert
-record index of final added zero
-loop backwards, replace item at index i with item at (i - zeros)
-if item hapens to be a zero and (i - zeros) <= index of final added zero,
 replace item at i - 1 with another zero, decrement zero count, decrement i
 to account for duplicated zero
-O(N)

best-simpler:
-count all zeros
-loop backwards
-if zero is encountered, decrement
-if i + zeros < len(arr), replace arr[i + zeros] with arr[i]
-if arr[i] == 0 and i + zeros + 1 < len(arr), replace arr[i + zeros + 1] with 0
-O(N)
