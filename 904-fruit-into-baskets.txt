-intialize max_fruit to zero
-initialize empty defaultdict(int) to keep track of the collected fruit
-initialize left pointer to zero, move right pointer forward with iteration
-when there are more than 2 types of fruit in the dict, advance left
 pointer and decrement until one fruit hits 0
-when a fruit hits zero, delete it from the dict to bring its length down to 2
-constantly update max fruit with (right - left + 1) or sum(dict_name.values())
-O(N)
