-floyd's cycle detection
-create a function that sums up the squares
 of the number's digits
-this will serve as the next pointer of our "linked list"
-initialize slow to f(num), initialize fast to f(f(num))
-loop until fast == 1 or slow == fast
-if fast == 1, no cycle, number is happy, return True
-otherwise, return False
-O(N)
