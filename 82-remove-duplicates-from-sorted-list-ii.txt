-possible for front of list to be deleted, so header node required
-prev node, cur node
-if cur == cur.next, advance cur until new value reached (comparing to prev.next.val in loop)
-set prev.next to new cur
-if that condition is triggered, no need to advance cur again
-otherwise set prev to cur and advance cur
